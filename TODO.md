# TODO
This file contains a list of the following things:
- Things I have not figure out yet
- Things I would like to dwell more on if and when time permits
- Things I would like to get to soon(ish)

### Tmux/SSH
- If I remotely log into an Ubuntu machine over SSH from my MacOS directly into a tmux session, I cannot seem to figure out a way to copy my selections into the Mac's system clipboard. It copies into Tmux "clipboard"
- Play with tmux.conf that is simpler than "Oh-my-Tmux"
