# TODO
Things that I have spent time on will be marked with a ~~strikethough~~

### Infrastructure
- ~~Create VMs using Ubuntu, CentOS images~~ (~~DO~~, ~~GCP~~, AWS, AZ)
- ~~Set it up as “Dev” machine~~ (~~DO~~, ~~GCP~~, AWS, AZ)
- ~~Create Snapshot~~ (~~DO~~, GCP, AWS, AZ)
- Recreate VMs using Snapshot 
- Assign DNS CNAME entries to created VMs
- Load Balancer with Let’s Encrypt certificate for the LB
- Private IP/Network
- Floating IP
- Firewalls
- PTR records
- Global Load Balancer
- CDN
- Block Storage
- S3/Spaces
- Nginx with firewall
- Nginx with Let’s Encrypt certificate
- Spin-up a Kubernetes cluster
- Design a Cloud Native Application with 3 Microservices: 1 web front-end Microservice and 2 API Microservices
- Write all 3 in Java OR Write front-end in Java, one API in Go and the other API in Python
- Build a Container Image for each of the Microservice
- Deploy each image to Google Container Registry OR DockerHub or Azure Container Registry

### Miscellaneous
1. If I remotely log into an Ubuntu machine over SSH from my MacOS directly into a tmux session, I cannot seem to figure out a way to copy my selections into the Mac's system clipboard. It copies into Tmux "clipboard"
2. Play with tmux.conf that is simpler than "Oh-my-Tmux"
